Coded triangle numbers
Problem 42
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

from string import ascii_uppercase

    n, triangles = 0, []
    max_word = max(value_of(word) for word in words)
    while n < max_word:
        triangles.append(n * (n + 1) // 2)
        n += 1

    return sum(1 for word in words if value_of(word) in triangles)
